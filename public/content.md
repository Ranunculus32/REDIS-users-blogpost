****** What to prepare as a first time mom and first time dad ********

Regardless of what age you are right now and of what background you have, it is always nerve wracking and stressful to think about all the baby things you need to prepare. I have been working in daycare for so many years and my husband is very confident that I know what I am doing with regards to the arrival of our son. It turns out, I am as clueless as any other new mom. So, I will list down the most absolute must for nesting new moms and dads .

First and foremost, look around your house.
Is it too crowded? Are the furnitures and displays dangerous for babies? How about the state of your house, is it baby friendly? Oftentimes, new parents stress buying baby items first before preparing the house for the arrival of the little one. It should be the other way around. By preparing the house, you get away with redundant cleaning that will surely happen when all baby items you purchased will start to add to the clutter in the house.

This is the time to throw all items you have been saving for so many years but were never put into good use, apart from taking space in your house. Furnitures that were left unattended and are very near to collapse has to be replaced or fixed now. All those nasty carpets that needed to be cleaned and old clothes which are either worn out or outgrown has to be disposed. May it be given to charity or going straight to the dump, your choice. I am not suggesting that you have to spend a lot of money to make the house looks good. I am saying that all heavy job with cleaning, decluttering and fixing has to be done now . Because cliche it might be but it is true, once you have a child you will have difficulty finding time to do other things than working and looking after them.

Prepare yourself
Very few people realized that from having no baby to one baby is a big leap. There is a huge difference with your lifestyle. The last 2 weeks of pregnancy and the first 6 weeks of life of a newborn is the most difficult. As the mother gets closer to giving birth, the dependence towards the non-pregnant partner increases as her mobility decreases and her discomfort increases. The non-pregnant partner can only be a support to what she externally needs, because only her has to go through the extreme pain of pushing out another human being. It will be her body that will be momentarily destroyed with tears and marks that she will be wearing like a warrior for the rest of her life.

I am not minimizing the effort or the stress of the father in this regard. The birth of a child is also the birth of a mother and a father. Both of you will discover emotions and connection you never experience before towards another human being. The feeling of purpose and responsibility is both sweet and heavy for new parents. And so together, you will spend sleepless nights to keep your little one alive and happy.

Another very important thing, know that with sleepless nights and intense days, the tension between you and your partner will increase. The mamma bear in you will come out, and this is not totally your fault. Your hormones added with many sleepless nights will make you a very fierce mama. Of course this will not sit well with your equally stressed out partner, who is the one running your house, now that your whole focus is the baby.

I remember when our first child was born, I realized that I am very easily irritated with whatever my husband is doing for the baby. In my eyes, I am the only one who knows the best, and so his method is subpar compare to mine. I end up micromanaging him that drove him insane. When both of us are frustrated, there are still things to be done but this time, our feelings towards it is filled with dread , frustration and even anger. It does not create an ideal atmosphere in looking after a newborn. So, I sat him down and told him to give me some slack. I cannot control my raging hormones. I can try to wrestle with my mind and find reason to why I am feeling such. But sometimes, emotions run non-stop when driven by hormones and stress. I am extremely sensitive and overly thinker at that time. It takes a lot of patience and understanding on his part to keep our peace and I am so glad that he gave me passes in those very difficult months. I always tell him, "Our time will come. Just bear with me".

Keep in mind that before the pregnancy, your focus is towards each other. When the baby arrives, both of your focus will be on the baby. I am not saying you will disregard each other, but with a very needy and helpless child in between, you will struggle to find time for each other. Just be prepare that this time will come, and so try to remind each other to take little moments together.


***************** PRACTICAL ADVICE FOR NEW PARENTS ****************************
Prepare baby items
Start with buying the furnitures, car seat and baby stroller. Buy only what the baby will absolutely needs. The first year of life the baby is indeed very fragile and needs a lot of protection and attention from us, but they are also less mobile. And so their needs are not as expensive as the social media moms make you believe.

Buy clothes with no more than 5 of everything. Do not buy a dozen blanket, socks, hat, pajama etc. Do not buy shoes either. Most babies are mostly carried in their first year of life, and so the shoes nomatter how cute they may, are not necessary. Bear in mind next time you are back in your favorite shopping website, "I need this, not the baby". That should stop you from your shopping spree.

I know it is very tempting to dress up the baby cute outfits everyday. Mind you, those items are not sold cheap. But you will realized after the fact that your baby can wear them only twice or 3x at most. The thing is, babies grow so much in a month. In fact, you will find yourself buying everything every single month.

Besides, your family and friends will most likely gift you with baby items in baby shower or upon your baby's arrival when they come and visit. So, keep your shopping spree on the minimum. Old moms are so willing and open to give old baby items. Do not be offended when offered second hand items, be grateful instead. Because having babies is not cheap. When you add up all the cost from maternity clothes, vitamins and baby items, you will be in for a surprise of how much it cost.

Cook food enough to last for at least 6 weeks!
Most likely, you are twitching your nose reading this part. But let me explain and stay with me.

Once you are ready to take your baby home, the real work begun. The baby will be feeding every 2 hours. And since babies are not really fast eater, you realize that each feeding last 30 min and so the 2 hours in between does not feel so long anymore. Besides, there is a minimum of 12 nappy change in every 24-hour. Newly born babies have very sensitive skin, and it is very important to change them right after they pee or poop. Yes, it will be so laborious that is why it is commonly advised that moms should not forget to brush their teeth or have a shower. Because it is so easy to just choose to sleep than self-care. It is that intense.

This is why I highly recommend new parents to start cooking like crazy four weeks before the due date. Look for recipes online and make really good meals. Cook your favorite food , in fact do not be cheap with ingredients. Pack them well in lunch boxes and freeze them. Make sure to label each lunch box so you know what to get. You will find this very helpful, knowing that there is always food that you can eat in just few minutes in the microwave. For new moms and dads, you need all good things around you. Eating good food, helps to lift your mood which is great when your life revolve around feeding the baby. Besides, cooking in advance is a lot better than fast food, or sandwiches and a lot cheaper than food orders.

To save a lot of time, buy your groceries online. The first 6 weeks up to three months is really so intense and you need every minute you can save. What my husband and I did is stock up food and drinks. At least drinks that will have longer shelf life. Of course milk, yoghurt and bread has to be purchased fresh.

Eating good food, is really well appreciated during these times.

                ******* Must have baby items *********

When I become a mom of two, I become wiser with my purchases. Below are the five must have baby items to make your second motherhood more efficient and almost effortless. 

1. Najell Babynest. This is the most useful baby item for me and my husband in the first 4 months of life of our second child. In fact, in those months she barely slept in her baby crib. This product makes our life so much easier. She sleep in it in the morning, and since it can be open up to be a playmat, she stays on it most of the day. When we have to use the stroller, we just lift the babynest to the stroller and we are ready to go. And when she falls asleep, moving her around while in it, is not disturbing her at all. Even at night, she slept inside the nest which is easy for me and my husband to do the baby duty as we just lift her around in it.  The best buy we ever made! 

2. Medela double breast pump and medela pumping bra. These two has to come together. The pumping makes busy mom conserve more time by being efficient. I usually pump for 10min every 5 hours. And this is just so easy to use and so nipple friendly. 

3. Ikea led lamp : Kornsnö and Spiken. These are the cheapest and most practical lamps I used mainly for nightly baby duties. Spiken led lamp allows different colors, and I mainly used the red and the yellow light. Red is mainly on for the whole night so I can see things around when baby while not disturbing our sleep. And the yellow is when I change nappies. The Kornsnö is for when I need a stronger light in just one tap. Easy to turn on and off and it turns off on its own after about 10min. 

4. Organizer bag. Any bag will do. This is where you put all baby essentials: diapers, wet wipes, nipple cream, baby poweder, creams, pacifiers etc. Find a lightweight organizer that you can easily carry around the house when you look after your baby. Trust me, life is a lot easier with baby essentials in a carry on organizer bag than in a box stayed in one place. 

5. Baby pajamas and mommy pajamas. Baby pajamas may not look so cute compare to smart suit or beautiful dresses that many new parents prefer to dress up their babies, but mind you these are the most practical. You will realized that a newborn sleeps a lot and feed and poop a lot. So, a normal day would be 10 soiled diapers and two new clothes. Pajamas, is the easiest for nappy changing and comfort of the child. 

As for the mommy pajamas. You have to remember that the first 6 weeks postpartum is crucial for recovery. Some new mothers will experience night sweating, chills and shivers, milk leaking and constant blood vaginal discharge as well. Having a comfortable and warm satin pajamas really is god send. Easy to put on and off, warm and soft and is just made to make you comfortable with your new body. 

I know there are still more useful items out there, but as a second time mother, these 5 above are the most useful, practical and cost efficient products that makes life so much easier specially made for multitasking parents.

******* Mom of two: How to love my children equally? *******


It is easy to give all our time to one child. Focus activities are not so complicated. However, when baby number two arrives, then somehow time is not so much in your favor anymore. Juggling your time between an active toddler and a sleepy newborn, is not easy. Most parents wonder, how can they best spend their time so the toddler will not feel left out while satisfying the need of a newborn.

With that, I have 3 useful advice. 

1. Alternate your time with both child. It is normal that the first two weeks after the birth of second child, that the mother will stay mainly with the newborn. For one, the mother is still sore and tired from birthing and is recovering. After two weeks however, most moms can do little walks without so much pain and discomfort. This is the time that she can start spending time with the toddler. The mother can pump milk or use formula and leave the newborn with the dad for an hour or two. She can do the activities she used to do with the toddler and the dad can bond with the newborn. It is important that she spend time with the toddler, even if most of the heavy lifting goes to the dad, so the first child will not be jealous and felt robbed off a mother. 

2. Pick an activity or a moment in a day. For example, mom can do the dinner time and dad can do the sleeping time. Mom can do the morning walk with the baby and dad can drop off the toddler to daycare. Small things here and there becomes big. Team work is the key.  

3. Choose your words wisely. When dealing with a very eager toddler to play with you, while you are with your newborn, instead of using your newborn as an excuse to say no, say instead : "Give me x time and I will be with you". If you say, "I cannot play with you because I am with x.." the toddler will transfer the blame to the baby as to why mommy or daddy is not available, and we don't want that. And when you are playing with the toddler and the baby is becoming fussy, in a loud voice say, "Wait xxx I am with your brother/sister, I will come with you shortly". Of course, you do not want the baby to be screaming in distress for a long period of time, just enough to make your point accross. This is in the benefit of the toddler, to associate that you as a parent, is giving both children equal attention and affection.

******* Keeping the spark alive while being parents ******

Dating is the easiest and most fun stage of life. Plenty of surprises, travels and gift givings. But once the baby is born, from being free to home bound is often too high of an adjustment for some of the couples to survive the relationship. It is no wonder, because from looking only each other and yourself, now you have to spend most of your waking hours in the first year to look after a new human being. 

For very tired parents who forgot that they are once wife and husband or man and woman, here are some points to keep the romance alive. 

Touch.
Kiss.
Hug.

Touch. Life is no doubt very intense, busy and even stinky (pun intended) in the first year of a child as parents. It is often difficult to find time to look after yourself, even more so to have time to be with your spouse. But a simple touch or brush of the skin when you both are hurrying with your duties, can make a lot of difference. A touch can be only be a fraction of a second, but in this little act your partner will feel seen. And that matters.

Kiss. A simple affirmation in this chaotic new schedule makes a lot of difference. Remember parenthood, is both a joy and a burden for you and your partner to carry on for the next 18 years. Might as well make it nice by being affectionate with your partner. 

Hug. When one is overwhelmed emotionally or physically with the demanding duties at home, hug can go further than words ever could. Hug your partner specially when he or she do not deserve it. Having a loving, gentle and supportive partnership is more than what a child needs. A child who grow up with parents who choose to love each other most of the days, has a good start in life.

**********ABOUT PAGE**********
When I was in my teen, I always thought I had a good childhood. I laugh with friends on how we are beaten, hanged inside a sack, and sometimes starved as a form of discipline if we messed around. Sorrounded with people with similar background, it just sounds so normal that we even compare each other's severity of punishment and laugh about it. 

In my adulthood I left Asia and move to Europe and start having healthy relationships. I look back on my childhood days, and it made me extremely sad. I now can see in my adult eyes how deprived, abused and neglected I was. 

I worked as a preschool teacher for many years, and it gave me the possibility to allow children's playfullness without severe consequences and go with them in their wild curiosity of this world. It was a beautiful job seeing the beauty of the world again in the eyes of innocent children.

Now a mother myself of two beautiful children, I used the knowledge and experience as a preschool teacher to bring up my children. And I swore that I will not pass on the abuse I suffer. They will have a good life and a happy childhood.

With this responsibility in mind, I created this blog to write down all my wishes and hopes and practices to make my goal come true. 

I am responsible of their childhood, I will make it the best they could ever wished for. They will be taught, guided and loved.

This blog, reflects the love of a mother towards her children while struggling with multiple responsibilities in life as a modern woman.
