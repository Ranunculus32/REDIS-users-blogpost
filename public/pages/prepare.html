              Regardless of what age you are right now and of what background
              you have, it is always nerve wracking and stressful to think about
              all the baby things you need to prepare. I have been working in
              daycare for so many years and my husband is very confident that I
              know what I am doing with regards to the arrival of our son. It
              turns out, I am as clueless as any other new mom. So, I will list
              down the most absolute must for nesting new moms and dads .
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              First and foremost, look around your house. Is it too crowded? Are
              the furnitures and displays dangerous for babies? How about the
              state of your house, is it baby friendly? Oftentimes, new parents
              stress buying baby items first before preparing the house for the
              arrival of the little one. It should be the other way around. By
              preparing the house, you get away with redundant cleaning that
              will surely happen when all baby items you purchased will start to
              add to the clutter in the house.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              This is the time to throw all items you have been saving for so
              many years but were never put into good use, apart from taking
              space in your house. Furnitures that were left unattended and are
              very near to collapse has to be replaced or fixed now. All those
              nasty carpets that needed to be cleaned and old clothes which are
              either worn out or outgrown has to be disposed. May it be given to
              charity or going straight to the dump, your choice. I am not
              suggesting that you have to spend a lot of money to make the house
              looks good. I am saying that all heavy job with cleaning,
              decluttering and fixing has to be done now . Because cliche it
              might be but it is true, once you have a child you will have
              difficulty finding time to do other things than working and
              looking after them.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Prepare yourself Very few people realized that from having no baby
              to one baby is a big leap. There is a huge difference with your
              lifestyle. The last 2 weeks of pregnancy and the first 6 weeks of
              life of a newborn is the most difficult. As the mother gets closer
              to giving birth, the dependence towards the non-pregnant partner
              increases as her mobility decreases and her discomfort increases.
              The non-pregnant partner can only be a support to what she
              externally needs, because only her has to go through the extreme
              pain of pushing out another human being. It will be her body that
              will be momentarily destroyed with tears and marks that she will
              be wearing like a warrior for the rest of her life.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I am not minimizing the effort or the stress of the father in this
              regard. The birth of a child is also the birth of a mother and a
              father. Both of you will discover emotions and connection you
              never experience before towards another human being. The feeling
              of purpose and responsibility is both sweet and heavy for new
              parents. And so together, you will spend sleepless nights to keep
              your little one alive and happy.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Another very important thing, know that with sleepless nights and
              intense days, the tension between you and your partner will
              increase. The mamma bear in you will come out, and this is not
              totally your fault. Your hormones added with many sleepless nights
              will make you a very fierce mama. Of course this will not sit well
              with your equally stressed out partner, who is the one running
              your house, now that your whole focus is the baby.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I remember when our first child was born, I realized that I am
              very easily irritated with whatever my husband is doing for the
              baby. In my eyes, I am the only one who knows the best, and so his
              method is subpar compare to mine. I end up micromanaging him that
              drove him insane. When both of us are frustrated, there are still
              things to be done but this time, our feelings towards it is filled
              with dread , frustration and even anger. It does not create an
              ideal atmosphere in looking after a newborn. So, I sat him down
              and told him to give me some slack. I cannot control my raging
              hormones. I can try to wrestle with my mind and find reason to why
              I am feeling such. But sometimes, emotions run non-stop when
              driven by hormones and stress. I am extremely sensitive and overly
              thinker at that time. It takes a lot of patience and understanding
              on his part to keep our peace and I am so glad that he gave me
              passes in those very difficult months. I always tell him, "Our
              time will come. Just bear with me".
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Keep in mind that before the pregnancy, your focus is towards each
              other. When the baby arrives, both of your focus will be on the
              baby. I am not saying you will disregard each other, but with a
              very needy and helpless child in between, you will struggle to
              find time for each other. Just be prepare that this time will
              come, and so try to remind each other to take little moments
              together.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              During the nesting period, you might be overwhelmed with so many
              things to prepare. It is always good to reach out to experienced
              parents or to family and friends. Do not do it alone, reach out to
              your village.
