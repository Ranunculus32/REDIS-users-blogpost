              It is easy to give all our time to one child. Focus activities are
              not so complicated. However, when baby number two arrives, then
              somehow time is not so much in your favor anymore. Juggling your
              time between an active toddler and a sleepy newborn, is not easy.
              Most parents wonder, how can they best spend their time so the
              toddler will not feel left out while satisfying the need of a
              newborn.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>With that, I have 3 useful advice.</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              1. Alternate your time with both child. It is normal that the
              first two weeks after the birth of second child, that the mother
              will stay mainly with the newborn. For one, the mother is still
              sore and tired from birthing and is recovering. After two weeks
              however, most moms can do little walks without so much pain and
              discomfort. This is the time that she can start spending time with
              the toddler. The mother can pump milk or use formula and leave the
              newborn with the dad for an hour or two. She can do the activities
              she used to do with the toddler and the dad can bond with the
              newborn. It is important that she spend time with the toddler,
              even if most of the heavy lifting goes to the dad, so the first
              child will not be jealous and felt robbed off a mother.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              2. Pick an activity or a moment in a day. For example, mom can do
              the dinner time and dad can do the sleeping time. Mom can do the
              morning walk with the baby and dad can drop off the toddler to
              daycare. Small things here and there becomes big. Team work is the
              key.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              3. Choose your words wisely. When dealing with a very eager
              toddler to play with you, while you are with your newborn, instead
              of using your newborn as an excuse to say no, say instead : "Give
              me x time and I will be with you". If you say, "I cannot play with
              you because I am with x.." the toddler will transfer the blame to
              the baby as to why mommy or daddy is not available, and we don't
              want that. And when you are playing with the toddler and the baby
              is becoming fussy, in a loud voice say, "Wait xxx I am with your
              brother/sister, I will come with you shortly". Of course, you do
              not want the baby to be screaming in distress for a long period of
              time, just enough to make your point accross. This is in the
              benefit of the toddler, to associate that you as a parent, is
              giving both children equal attention and affection.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              It is always a struggle to keep the balance of giving equal
              attention to all children. But be comforted that as long as you
              try, it is all worth it and occassional failure does not make you
              a bad parent. Just another struggling mother or father who do the
              best possible for the children.
