              When I become a mom of two, I become wiser with my purchases.
              Below are the six must have baby items to make your second
              motherhood more efficient and almost effortless.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              1. <a href="#"> Najell Babynest.</a> This is the most useful baby
              item for me and my husband in the first 4 months of life of our
              second child. In fact, in those months she barely slept in her
              baby crib. This product makes our life so much easier. She sleep
              in it in the morning, and since it can be open up to be a playmat,
              she stays on it most of the day. When we have to use the stroller,
              we just lift the babynest to the stroller and we are ready to go.
              And when she falls asleep, moving her around while in it, is not
              disturbing her at all. Even at night, she slept inside the nest
              which is easy for me and my husband to do the baby duty as we just
              lift her around in it. The best buy we ever made!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              2.
              <a href="#"> Medela double breast pump and medela pumping bra.</a
              >These two has to come together. The pumping makes busy mom
              conserve more time by being efficient. I usually pump for 10min
              every 5 hours. And this is just so easy to use and so nipple
              friendly.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              3.
              <a href="#"> Ikea led lamp : Kornsnö and Spiken.</a>
              These are the cheapest and most practical lamps I used mainly for
              nightly baby duties. Spiken led lamp allows different colors, and
              I mainly used the red and the yellow light. Red is mainly on for
              the whole night so I can see things around while not disturbing
              our sleep. And the yellow is when I change nappies. The Kornsnö is
              for when I need a stronger light in just one tap. Easy to turn on
              and off and it turns off on its own after about 10min.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              4. Organizer bag. Any bag will do. This is where you put all baby
              essentials: diapers, wet wipes, nipple cream, baby poweder,
              creams, pacifiers etc. Find a lightweight organizer that you can
              easily carry around the house when you look after your baby. Trust
              me, life is a lot easier with baby essentials in a carry on
              organizer bag than in a box stayed in one place.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              5. Baby pajamas. Baby pajamas may not look so cute compare to
              smart suit or beautiful dresses that many new parents prefer to
              dress up their babies, but mind you these are the most practical.
              You will realized that a newborn sleeps a lot and feed and poop a
              lot. So, a normal day would be 10 soiled diapers and two new
              clothes. Pajamas, is the easiest for nappy changing and comfort of
              the child.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <a href="#">5. Satin mommy pajamas. </a> You have to remember that
              the first 6 weeks postpartum is crucial for recovery. Some new
              mothers will experience night sweating, chills and shivers, milk
              leaking and constant blood vaginal discharge as well. Having a
              comfortable and warm satin pajamas really is god send. Easy to put
              on and off, warm and soft and is just made to make you comfortable
              with your new body.
            </p>
            <p>
              I know there are still more useful items out there, but as a
              second time mother, these 5 above are the most useful, practical
              and cost efficient products that makes life so much easier
              specially made for multitasking parents.
